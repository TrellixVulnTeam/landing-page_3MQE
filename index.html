					<div id= "title-text">About James</div>
					<div id = "text">I'm a sophomore at the University of California, Berkeley. Currently studying Computer Science and Economics, I have a passion for the abstract intricacies of programming, and the big-picture analytics of scarcity and optimization. As a trumpet player in the University of California Marching Band, I spend free time performing at Cal's home football games and other large events, most notably the recent Super Bowl 50 Halftime show. As a child of a diplomatic family, I grew up abroad, only spending first and tenth grade in the United States. My time in Chile, Bulgaria, Argentina, and China has been invaluable, forming the best aspects of my character. Living outside the U.S. has left me with more than just proficiency in Mandarin and Spanish, but with perspective, adaptability, and an insatiable hunger for new challenges and adventures.

						<div id = "text">At Uber China, I worked in Product Operations. Specifically, my team was tasked with tracking local rideshare competitors DiDi ChuXing (滴滴出行), ShenZhou ZhuanChe (神州专车), and Yidao YongChe (一道用车). While full-time programmers and I created web applications that handled data, the rest of the team used them to analyze the competition. I filled a full-stack development role; the web-apps I built ran on a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). They handled user input to perform key calculations, visualizations, and other means of analysis over the continually updating databases. I utilized HTML5/CSS3, jQuery, Javascript, Java, PHP, SQL, and Linux shell script. Co-workers and superiors used these tools to better understand competitors, marketshare, and rivals' driver subsidy strategies. </div>

I will graduate with a major in Computer Science and a minor concentration in Economics.

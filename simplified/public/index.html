  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I'm a developer currently studying computer science at Berkeley. Growing up overseas in a diplomatic family has given me a broad personal perspective of the world, as I've had a chance to meet the cultures of Chile, Bulgaria, Argentina, and China.
    In an increasingly connected world, I continue to be excited by the applications of computing. Institutions that harness these applications have changed (and will continue to change) commerce, politics, healthcare, and all other facets of society.
    Software has a profound impact on everyting, and only our imagination and effort limit what can be done. This is what excites me.</p>

  <h3>Education</h3>
  <h4>B.A. Computer Science (2019) - University of California, Berkeley</h4>
  <p>As a student at UC Berkeley, I've had the opportunity to explore some incredible material with great professors. A few of my favorite courses include Efficient Algortithms and Intractable Problems (CS 170), Data Structures (CS 61B), Introduction to Machine Learning (CS 189), and Soccer: A Global History (Hist 190). As a third year, I'm excited to get out into industry, but am also cherishing the time I have to learn in an academic setting.</p>

  <h3>Projects</h3>

      <a href="https://www.github.com/jrigassio/hivestats" target="_blank">
      <div>HiveStats (Efficient SSH at UCB)</div>
    </a>
      <div>This command-line utility helps students navigate the instructional servers (i.e. hiveXX@cs.berkeley.edu) in the EECS department at UC Berkeley. I wrote this in a few afternoons over winter break during my junior year.  The tool automatically logs students into the least-busy instructional server via SSH, saving student time when CPU-intensive course projects are assigned.</div>

      <a href="http://bachchain.mybluemix.net/" target="_blank">
        <div>BachChain</div>
      </a>
      <div>This project explored an application of blockchain technology. Built on Bluemix as part of BlueHack 2017, my housemates and I created a democratized music-sharing platform secured though smart-contracts and an mp3 hashing function. Here is a YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIz5hNaBbh8&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">video</a> we made documenting the project, and the <a href="https://github.com/jrigassio/bach-chain" target="_blank">code</a> on Github.</div>

  <h3>Work Experience</h3>
  <p>I'm proud of the time I have spent interning for a few software companies over my summers as an undergrad. I like interning, being paid to learn in industry is a tremendous opportunity. I have had the pleasure of working under a few incredible mentors in Fulton Byrne (IBM) and Ferrari Wu (Uber). Detailed information can be found on <a href="assets/documents/James_Rigassio_Resume.pdf" target="_blank" >my resume</a>.</p>

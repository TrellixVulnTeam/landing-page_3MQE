  <h3>About Me</h3>

  <h3>Education</h3>
  <p>As a computer science major at UC Berkeley, I've had the opportunity to explore some incredible material with great professors. A few of my favorite courses include Efficient Algortithms and Intractable Problems (CS 170), Data Structures (CS 61B), and Introduction to Machine Learning (CS 189). As a third year, I'm excited to get out into industry, but am also cherishing the time I have to learn in an academic setting.</p>

      <div>HiveStats (Efficient SSH at UCB)</div>
    </a>
      <div>This command-line utility helps students navigate the instructional servers (i.e. hiveXX@cs.berkeley.edu) in the EECS department at UC Berkeley. I wrote this in a few afternoons over winter break during my junior year.  The tool automatically logs students into the least-busy instructional server via SSH, saving student time when CPU-intensive course projects are assigned.</div>

  <h3>Work Experience</h3>
  <p>I'm proud of the time I have spent interning for a few software companies over my summers as an undergrad. I like interning: being paid to learn about practical applications of what I'm studying is a sweet deal. I've also had the pleasure of working under a few incredible mentors in Fulton Byrne (IBM) and Ferrari Wu (Uber).
